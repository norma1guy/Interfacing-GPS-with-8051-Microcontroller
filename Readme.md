# Introduction:
A GPS module is a device that uses Global Positioning System to
determine the location of a vehicle or person. GPS receivers are used to
provide reliable navigation, positioning and timing services to the users at
anytime and anywhere on the earth. This Global positioning system uses
24 to 32 satellites to provide the data to the receivers. GPS has become
very important for worldwide navigation and it is useful for land surveying,
way marking, map-making, tracking and surveillance commerce and
scientific uses.

# Working:
GPS module calculates the position by reading the signals that are
transmitted by the satellites. Each satellite transmits the messages
continuously which contains time was sent. GPS receiver measures the
distance to each satellite based on the arrival time of each message. This
information is used to calculate the position of the GPS receiver. The
received raw data is converted for the user as LATITUDE, LONGITUDE,
ALTITUDE, SPEED and TIME.
